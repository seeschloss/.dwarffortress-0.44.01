My original inspiration was Tocky's tileset. Almost every tile has since been redrawn since then, but not all of them. Tocky's colours are also included.

Credits go to Vherid for the inspiration for some of the racial graphics and to PigtailLlama for the gem tile inspiration.

The Taffer colours were originally posted by Tamber-Krain, then modified by myself. Used with permission.

The Dawnbringer colours are taken solely from DawnBringer's wonderful 16 colour palette (http://www.pixeljoint.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=12795) and the 32 colour palette (http://www.pixeljoint.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=16247), with DragonDePlatino's help.

Thank you to RawberryCough for allowing me to use the Rawberry color scheme (https://www.reddit.com/r/dwarffortress/comments/3mbg4f/just_wanted_to_share_a_color_scheme_i_put_together/).
