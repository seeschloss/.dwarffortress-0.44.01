The mousewheel-zlevels folder contains my personal keybindings. The only differences are listed below.

 - In addition to the existing < and > keys, the mousewheel also changes z-levels instead of zooming.
 - To zoom, you now need to hold down Ctrl while using the mousewheel.

You still require a number pad for satisfactory use of the game. For keybindings that works better on laptops look for an updated version of the Lazy Newb Pack (or DF Starter Pack) and copy over the appropriate keybindings file. (interface.txt).
